# Prediction-of-hypoxemia-trend

Hypoxemia – an abnormally low level of oxygen in the blood – is one of the most common and life-threatening critical illnesses in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). It occurs when a person’s arterial blood oxygen partial pressure is less than 80 mmHg. If mild hypoxemia is not detected or treated immediately, it may transform into moderate or severe hypoxemia, which is directly associated with mortality. Mechanical ventilation (MV) is one of the most common interventions implemented in the ICU to help patients to recover from a variety of conditions including hypoxemia. However, prolonged unnecessary mechanical ventilation can cause multiple organ failures such as lung injury and inflammation. Therefore, it is important to accurately and timely predict the severity level of hypoxemia that enables healthcare providers to perform timely oxygen therapy and infusion control.
